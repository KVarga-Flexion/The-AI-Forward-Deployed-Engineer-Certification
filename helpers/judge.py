"""LLM-as-a-judge, with the calibration step attached.

Tier 2. Declare `litellm` in your notebook's PEP 723 block.

Week 4 Session 1 builds a judge from scratch, and then makes the point that
matters: **an uncalibrated judge is worse than no judge**, because it produces a
number and numbers end conversations. This is that judge, packaged, with the
calibration impossible to skip — `Judge.score()` refuses to run until you have
called `calibrate()` and it passed.

That refusal is the whole design. Everything else here is plumbing.
