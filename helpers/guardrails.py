"""A guardrail ladder you can measure, and therefore defend.

Tier 2 by convention. Imports nothing heavier than the standard library; the
rungs you pass in may import whatever they like.

Week 6 Session 1 builds the ladder from scratch — logit masking, regex, a
trained classifier, an LLM judge, a policy layer — and the point of building all
five is that they cost wildly different amounts and catch different things. This
packages the part that makes it deployable rather than demonstrable.

**Order is the design.** Rungs run cheapest-first and the ladder short-circuits
on the first block, so the expensive judge only ever sees what the free checks
let through. Put the LLM judge first and you have paid for it on every single
request, including the 99% a regex would have cleared for nothing.

**The number that decides whether it ships is the false-positive rate.** A
guardrail that catches every attack and also blocks four percent of legitimate
traffic will be switched off within a month, and then you have no guardrail at
all. Catching attacks is the easy half. `evaluate()` therefore refuses to report
coverage without also reporting what the ladder did to your known-good cases —
your Week 4 golden set is exactly the right input.
