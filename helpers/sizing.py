"""How much memory serving this model actually needs.

Tier 2 by convention. Standard library only.

Week 2 lists download sizes, which is the number people plan with and the wrong
one. A 7B model is a ~14 GB download at fp16 and will not serve 32k context to
eight concurrent users on a 16 GB card, because the **KV cache is not in the
download**. It is allocated per request, it grows linearly with context length
and batch size, and at long context it routinely exceeds the weights.

That gap is where "we tried it on my laptop and it was fine" becomes "it OOMs in
staging". This module does the arithmetic, and it takes the model's real
`config.json` rather than numbers anyone typed from memory — the layer count and
head geometry that drive the cache are in the file the weights shipped with.

The estimate is deliberately a *floor* plus a stated overhead. Real servers add
fragmentation, CUDA graphs, and their own paging; vLLM will happily reserve most
of a card up front. Treat the output as "you certainly need at least this", never
as a budget you can fill.
