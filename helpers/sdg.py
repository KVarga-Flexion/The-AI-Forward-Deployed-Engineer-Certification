"""Synthetic data generation, and the deduplication that decides its real size.

Tier 2. Declare `litellm` in your notebook's PEP 723 block.

Week 2 Session 2 builds this from scratch. This is the packaged version, and it
keeps the two things students most often drop:

**The axes are the coverage.** Generating "200 more like these" gives 200
paraphrases of five things. Generating across named axes gives you a dataset
whose blind spots you can describe — which is the only kind worth having.

**The honest count.** The size of your dataset is not how many rows you
generated. It is how many survived deduplication *and* schema validation. That
number is usually far smaller, and quoting the first one is how teams come to
believe they tested something they did not.
