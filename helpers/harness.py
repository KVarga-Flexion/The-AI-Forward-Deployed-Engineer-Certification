"""Eval runs you can persist, re-run, and compare — the referee for Weeks 5-8.

Tier 2 by convention (not re-exported from `helpers/__init__`), though it
imports nothing heavier than the standard library, so it is safe anywhere.

Week 4 Session 1 builds `run_eval` and `report` from scratch, and that is the
lesson. This is what those become once *other weeks* have to trust the number.

The problem it solves is stated in TC4 and then left manual: "record the
baseline number in `use_case/decisions.md`." A number typed into prose cannot be
compared by anything, drifts the moment the case set changes, and quietly
becomes a claim rather than a measurement. TC8 — replace the closed model with a
fine-tuned open one and **pass the same harness** — is unfulfillable if the
baseline is a sentence someone wrote in week four.

So a run is an artifact:

    report = run(cases, my_system, SCORERS, name="baseline")
    save(report, CFG.use_case / "evals" / "baseline.json")

    # ... five weeks later, a different model ...
    candidate = run(cases, new_system, SCORERS, name="finetuned")
    print(compare(load(path), candidate))

**The comparison refuses when the case sets differ.** This is the whole point.
0.94 on the twelve cases you had in Week 4 versus 0.91 on the sixty you have by
Week 8 is not a regression, and treating it as one — or worse, treating 0.94 on
three cases as a win over 0.91 on sixty — is the most common way eval numbers
come to mean nothing. Every report carries a fingerprint of the cases and
scorers that produced it, and `compare()` will not silently cross that line.
