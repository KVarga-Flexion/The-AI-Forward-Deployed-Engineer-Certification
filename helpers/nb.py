"""The four things every notebook does before it does anything else.

Notebooks in this repo have to run two ways: inside the root `uv` environment, and
standalone under `marimo edit --sandbox`, where there is no root venv and `helpers/`
is not on `sys.path`. `bootstrap()` works identically in both, because it derives
everything from the notebook's own location on disk rather than from the
environment. That is the whole trick.

Tier 1: stdlib + python-dotenv only.
