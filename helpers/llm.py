"""One place where model calls are made, so there is one place to fix them.

Tier 2. Declare `litellm` in your notebook's PEP 723 block.

Every notebook in this course teaches its own model call from scratch, and that
is deliberate — a `completion()` you can read is worth more than a wrapper you
trust. This module is what you reach for *after* that lesson, when the call has
stopped being the subject and started being plumbing.

Three things it does that a bare `completion()` does not, each one earned:

**An explicit timeout.** Week 3 measured what an inherited default costs: a
request that outruns the client timeout is cancelled server-side, the work
already done is discarded, and a naive retry re-sends the identical request to
fail identically. Forty minutes, no result, and an error naming nothing useful.
A timeout you chose is a timeout you can reason about.

**Retrying only what retrying can fix.** A 429 is worth another attempt. A 400
is not — the request is malformed and will be just as malformed in four seconds.
Blind `for attempt in range(3)` loops turn a fast, clear failure into a slow,
confusing one, and they are the most common thing people copy out of a blog post.

**A count of what you spent.** Token usage is the number that decides whether a
project survives contact with a budget, and it is free to collect at the call
site. Ignoring it until someone asks is how teams discover their per-request
cost in a meeting rather than in a dashboard.
