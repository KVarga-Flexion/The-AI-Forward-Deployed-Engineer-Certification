"""Retrieval plumbing, so later weeks do not re-teach Week 3.

Tier 2. Import explicitly (`from helpers import rag`) and declare any heavy
dependencies in your notebook's PEP 723 block.

**These are not the lesson.** Week 3 builds chunking, embedding, and cosine
similarity from scratch, in the notebook, where you can read them. What lives
here is the finished version, so that Week 4's eval harness and Week 7's memory
work can import it instead of copying it.
